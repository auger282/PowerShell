# PowerShell
This is a collection of PowerShell scripts I use to manage Active Directory, Office 365, Exchange, Exchange Online, Skype for Business and more.

Please read the comment section of each script for any additional details or requirements. I've added lots of comments so it's easy to understand what's happening for a PowerShell beginner. If you have any script suggestions, improvements or questions please feel free to comment.

As always use at your own risk!
